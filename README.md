Document Tagging Tool. Developed as an alternative to [UAM Corpus Tool](http://corpustool.com/).

## What is it?

DocTT is a document tagging tool aimed to help linguists to easily annotate
their documents with an upgraded UI using web technologies.

It was developed as a semester project during the Bachelor of Science
in Computer Engineering at the University Of Applied Sciences of Southern
Switzerland ([SUPSI](http://supsi.ch/)) by [Denys Vitali](https://github.com/denysvitali/) and [Cristian Spozio](https://github.com/Bbrazorf/)

### Document Tagging
Given a text / rich text document, our tool provides an easy way to
tag the document by selecting a tag from a tree. Currently, this tool
only handles documents and trees imported from _UAM Corpus Tool_.
