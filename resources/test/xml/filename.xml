        Greetings and welcome to Microsoft's fourth quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings call. As a reminder, this
        conference is being recorded.
        It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Chris Suh, General Manager, Investor Relations. Thank you, you
        may begin.
        Chris Suh - General Manager-Investor Relations
        Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are: Satya Nadella,
        Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John
        Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. On our website, microsoft.com/investor, you can find
        our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared
        remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial
        measures.
        Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures
        provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance
        prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further
        understanding the company's fourth quarter performance in addition to the impact of these items and events had
        on financial results.
        Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes
        of our Form 10-Q, which includes research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative,
        but excludes the impact of integration and restructuring charges. As a reminder, in May we announced plans to
        further streamline the phone hardware business. During the fourth quarter, restructuring and related impairment
        expenses were $1.1 billion.
        All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless
        otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for
        assessing how our underlying business has performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
        At the segment level, we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to
        recent changes to our segment reporting groupings, we are not able to provide segment-level constant currency
        operating expense growth and consequently cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do
        provide constant currency operating expense and operating income growth at the companywide level.
        We'll post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is
        available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our
        live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view
        the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until July 19, 2017.
        During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other
        statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are
        subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's
        earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our
        Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not
        undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
        And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
        Satya Nadella - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director
        Thank you, Chris, and to everyone on the phone for joining. I want to thank all the Microsoft team members and
        partners who contributed to a successful year. We are proud of what we achieved and particularly how we are
        positioned for new growth. Today, Amy and I will share our fourth quarter results and our perspective on the
        year ahead.
        We delivered $22.6 billion in revenue this quarter, an increase of 5% for the quarter in constant currency. This
        past year was a pivotal one in both our transformation and in our partnerships with customers who are also
        driving their own digital transformation. Our progress is best captured in the results of our three ambitions,
        starting with Productivity and Business Process. In a world of infinite information but finite attention and
        time, we aim to change the nature of work with digital technology. In pursuit of this ambition, we continue to
        add value to our products, grow usage, and increase our addressable market. Along these lines, let me start with
        Office 365 and then move to Dynamics 365.
        In the last quarter, we advanced our collaboration tools. We launched Microsoft Planner, which helps teams
        manage operations, as well as Skype Meetings, which is aimed at helping small businesses collaborate. In June,
        we further strengthened our security value proposition with the release of Advanced Security Management.
        Lastly, we continue to add intelligence in machine learning to Office to help people automate their tasks and
        glean insights from data. These advancements helped to drive increased usage across enterprises, small and
        medium businesses, and consumers. In the enterprise, Office 365 Commercial seats grew 45% year over year, and
        revenue grew 59% in constant currency. Also 70% of our Office Enterprise agreement renewals are in the cloud.
        Innovative companies like Facebook, Hershey's, Discovery Communications, Cushman Wakefield all adopted Office
        365 and now see how transformative this service can be for their own business.
        We are enthusiastic about the early feedback and growth opportunity from companies using our newly released
        Office 365 E5, which includes powerful security controls, advanced analytics, and cloud voice. These customers
        tell us that they love the simplification that comes with standardizing across all of our productivity
        workloads.
        We see momentum in small and medium businesses, with a growing number of partners selling Office 365, now up to
        nearly 90,000, a 25% increase year over year. We continue to grab share and adding over 50,000 customers each
        month for 28 consecutive months.
        We also see momentum amongst consumers, with now more than 23 million Office 365 subscribers. Across segments,
        customers increasingly experience the power of Office on their iOS and Android mobile devices. In fact, we now
        have more than 50 million iOS and Android monthly active devices, up more than four times over last year.
        Now let's talk about progress with the other pillar of this ambition, Dynamics 365. We are removing any
        impedance that exists between productivity, collaboration, and business process. This month we took a major step
        forward with the introduction of Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft AppSource. Dynamics 365 provides business
        users with purpose-built SaaS applications. These applications have intelligence built in. They integrate deeply
        with communications and collaboration capabilities of Office 365.
        Dynamics 365 along with AppSource and our rich application platform introduces a disruptive and customer-centric
        business model so customers can build what they want and use just the capabilities they need. The launch of
        Dynamics 365 builds on the momentum we're already seeing in this business. Customers around the globe are
        harnessing the power of Dynamics in their own transformation, including 24 Hour Fitness and AccuWeather.
        Overall, Dynamics now has nearly 10 million monthly paid seats, up more than 20% year over year, and Q4 billings
        grew more than 20% year over year.
        Overall, Business Processes represent an enormous addressable market, projected to be more than $100 billion by
        2020. It's a market we are increasingly focused on, and I believe we are poised with both Dynamics 365 and
        Microsoft AppSource to grow and drive opportunity for our partners.
        Across Office 365 and Dynamics 365, developers increasingly see the opportunity to build innovative apps and
        experiences with the Microsoft Graph, and we now have over 27,000 apps connected to it. Microsoft AppSource will
        be a new way for developers to offer their services and reach customers worldwide.
        Lastly, with Office 365 and Dynamics 365, we have the opportunity to connect the world's professional cloud and
        the world's professional network with our pending LinkedIn deal. Overall, the Microsoft Cloud is winning
        significant customer support. With more than $12 billion in Commercial Cloud annualized revenue run rate, we are
        on track to achieve our goal of $20 billion in fiscal year 2018. Also, nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 companies
        have at least three of our cloud offerings. And we continue to grow our annuity mix of our business. In fact,
        commercial annuity mix increased year over year to 83%.
        Now let's get into the specifics of the Intelligent Cloud, an area of massive opportunity, as we are clearly one
        of the two enterprise cloud leaders. Companies looking to digitally transform need a trusted cloud partner and
        turn to Microsoft. As a result, Azure revenue and usage again grew by more than 100% this quarter. We see
        customers choose Microsoft for three reasons. They want a cloud provider that offers solutions that reflect the
        realities of today's world and their enterprise-grade needs. They want higher level services to drive digital
        transformation, and they want a cloud open to developers of all types. Let me expand on each.
        To start, a wide variety of customers turn to Azure because of their specific real-world needs. Multinationals
        choose us because we are the only hybrid and hyperscale cloud spanning multiple jurisdictions. We cover more
        countries and regions than any other cloud provider, from North America to Asia to Europe to Latin America. Our
        cloud respects data sovereignty and makes it possible for an enterprise application to work across these regions
        and jurisdictions. More than 80% of the world's largest banks are Azure customers because of our leadership
        support for regulatory requirements, advanced security, and commitment to privacy. Large ISVs like SAP and
        Citrix as well as startups like Sprinklr also choose Azure because of our global reach and a broad set of
        platform services. Last week GE announced it will adopt our cloud for its IoT approach.
        Next, Azure customers also value our unique higher-level services. Now at 33,000, we nearly doubled in one year
        the number of companies worldwide that have selected our Enterprise Mobility Solutions. The Dow Chemical Company
        leverages EMS along with Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics to give its thousands of employees secure real-time
        access to data and apps from anywhere.
        Just yesterday, we announced Boeing will use Azure, our IoT suite, and Cortana Intelligence to drive digital
        transformation in commercial aviation, with connected airline systems optimization, predictive maintenance, and
        much more. This builds on great momentum in IoT, including our work with Rolls-Royce, Schneider Electric, and
        others.
        This is great progress, but our ambitions are set even higher. Our Intelligent Cloud also enables cognitive
        services. Cortana Intelligence Suite offers machine learning capabilities and advanced predictive analytics.
        Customers like Jabil Circuit, Fruit of the Loom, Land O'Lakes, LIBER already realize the benefits of these new
        capabilities.
        Lastly, central to our Intelligent Cloud ambition is providing developers with the tools and capabilities they
        need to build apps and services for the platforms and devices of their choice. The new Azure Container service
        as well as .NET Core 1.0 for open source and our ongoing work with companies such as Red Hat, Docker, and
        Mesosphere reflects significant progress on this front. We continue to see traction from open source, with
        nearly a third of customer virtual machines on Azure running Linux.
        On the server side, premium server revenue grew double digits in constant currency year over year. New SQL
        Server 2016 helps us expand into new markets with built-in advanced analytics and unparalleled performance. More
        than 15,000 customers, including over 50% of the Fortune 500, have registered for the private preview of SQL
        Server for Linux. And we're not slowing down. We will launch Windows Server 2016 and System Server 2016 later
        this year.
        Now let's talk about the progress in More Personal Computing. We have increased Windows 10 monthly active
        devices and are now at more than 350 million. This is the fastest adoption rate of any prior Windows release.
        While we are proud of these results, given changes to our phone plan, we changed how we will assess progress.
        Going forward, we will track progress by regularly reporting the growth of Windows 10 monthly active devices in
        addition to progress on three aspects of our Windows strategy: first, deliver more value and innovation,
        particularly for enterprise customers; second, grow new monetization through services across our unified Windows
        platform; third, innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. Let me walk through each.
        We continue to pursue our goal of moving people from needing Windows to choosing Windows to loving Windows. In
        two weeks, we will launch Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which takes a significant step forward in security. We
        are also extending Windows Hello to support apps and websites and delivering a range of new features like
        Windows Ink and updates to Microsoft Edge. We expect these advances will drive increased adoption of Windows 10,
        particularly in the enterprise, in the coming year. We already have strong traction, with over 96% of our
        enterprise customers piloting Windows 10.
        Next, as we grow our install base and engagement, we generate more opportunity for Microsoft and our ecosystem.
        Bing profitability continues to grow, with greater than 40% of the search revenue in June from Windows 10
        devices. Bing PC query share in the United States approached 22% this quarter, not including volume from AOL and
        Yahoo!. The Cortana search box has over 100 million monthly active users, with 8 billion questions asked to
        date.
        We continue to drive growth in gaming by connecting fans on Xbox Live across Windows 10, iOS, and Android. Just
        this quarter we launched our Minecraft Realm subscription on Android and iOS. Overall engagement on Xbox Live is
        at record levels, with more than 49 million monthly active users, up 33% year over year. At E3 we announced our
        biggest lineup of exclusive games ever for Xbox One and Windows 10 PCs. And we announced Xbox Play Anywhere
        titles, where gamers can buy a game once and play it on both their Windows 10 PC and Xbox One. We also announced
        two new members of the Xbox One console family, the Xbox One S and Project Scorpio.
        The Windows Store continues to grow, with new universal Windows apps like Bank of America, Roku, SiriusXM,
        Instagram, Facebook, Wine, Hulu, and popular PC games like Quantum Break.
        Finally, we are innovating in new device categories in partnership with OEMs. Our hardware partners are
        embracing the new personal computing vision, with over 1,500 new devices designed to take advantage of Windows
        10 innovations like Touch, Pen, Hello, and better performance and power efficiency.
        Microsoft's family of Surface devices continues to drive category growth, and we are reaching more commercial
        customers of all sizes with the support of our channel partners. We recently announced new Surface enterprise
        initiatives with IBM and Booz Allen Hamilton to enable more customer segments. Also in the past year, we grew
        our commercial Surface partner channel from over 150 to over 10,000.
        Lastly this quarter, more and more developers and enterprise customers got to experience two entirely new device
        categories from Microsoft Surface Hub and Microsoft HoloLens. While we are still in the early days of both of
        these devices, we are seeing great traction with both enterprise customers and developers, making us optimistic
        about future growth.
        In closing, I want to reflect on the opportunity ahead of us. Simply put, businesses will not just use digital
        technologies, but they will become digital companies. This generates enormous opportunity for Microsoft and our
        partners. We are the ones who can empower digital transformation across all industries, companies, and
        geographies with our technology and platforms.
        With that, I'll hand it over to Amy to go through this quarter's results in greater detail and share our
        outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you after that to answer questions
        Amy E. Hood - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President
        Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $22.6 billion, up 2% and 5% in
        constant currency. Gross margin was flat but up 4% in constant currency. Operating income this quarter declined
        by 3% and grew 6% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $0.69, increasing 11% year over year or 27%
        in constant currency.
        Across most markets, our execution and results were generally as expected, with some strength in the U.S. But we
        did see additional softness in Brazil, the Middle East, and Africa, which were impacted by macroeconomic
        headwinds.
        From a seasonality perspective, the fourth quarter is always an important one for our Commercial business. Our
        results were strong, as our sales teams led with our cloud offers. Healthy renewals helped to drive double-digit
        annuity performance in constant currency. Our total annuity mix reached 83%, up one point year over year. While
        our Commercial Cloud continued to drive a higher annuity mix overall, we also had better than expected
        transactional revenue performance, as products like Office 2016 and SQL Server 2016 generated more deal volume.
        The dollar volume of expiring enterprise agreements was smaller this quarter than last year. On that base, our
        commercial bookings increased 4% in constant currency, driven by customer preference for our cloud offers.
        Commercial unearned revenue slightly beat our expectations at $24.6 billion or 8% growth in constant currency.
        Our contracted-not-billed [CNB] balance exceeded $25.5 billion. As Satya called out earlier, our Commercial
        Cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeded $12.1 billion, growing more than 50% year over year. Additionally,
        more than 70% of customers who signed enterprise agreements this quarter attached cloud offerings. Our
        Commercial Cloud gross margin was 42%, declining year over year, driven by investments for cloud capacity,
        deployment, and support.
        Now let's turn to company gross margin performance. We were above our COGS expectations due to approximately
        $200 million of inventory adjustments from the change in our phone hardware business. And as expected, our mix
        of cloud services revenue continued to increase, resulting in gross margin percentage declines in the
        Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments. Importantly, gross margin dollars expanded
        year over year in constant currency.
        In Q4, the FX impact on total and segment-level revenue was in line with expectations. FX had a three-point
        negative impact on Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud results and a two-point negative
        impact on More Personal Computing results.
        As we've noted in previous quarters, we're not able to provide constant currency impact at the segment level for
        operating expenses and therefore segment operating income. This quarter, total operating expenses grew 1% in
        constant currency, above our expectations due to legal settlements and revenue-driven sales cost. At the company
        level, our operating income grew 6% in constant currency, as FX had a nine-point impact on our results.
        Now let's turn to each segment. This quarter, our Productivity and Business Processes segment delivered results
        above our expectations, with nearly $7 billion in revenue, an increase of 5% and 8% in constant currency. In
        Office Commercial, revenue increased by 5% and 9% in constant currency, as Office 365 growth outpaced the shift
        from our on-premises business.
        Our seat growth was driven by broad-based momentum across commercial customers of all sizes. While we generally
        expect transactional purchasing to continue to decline, results across all products came in higher than
        anticipated this quarter. Office Consumer revenue increased 19% and 18% in constant currency, outperforming the
        consumer PC market, driven by seat growth, recurring subscription revenue, and six points of growth from Japan,
        which had a particularly weak quarter a year ago. And our Dynamics business grew 6%, up 7% in constant currency,
        with strong billings and seat growth.
        Segment gross margin dollars were flat and up 4% in constant currency. The gross margin percentage declined on a
        higher cloud revenue mix within the segment coupled with an increase in cloud investments. Operating expenses
        grew 6% from investments in Commercial Cloud sales programs and engineering. As a result, operating income
        declined 5%.
        The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered slightly more than $6.7 billion in revenue, growing 7% and 10% in
        constant currency. Demand and use of our hybrid cloud offerings led to another quarter of double-digit annuity
        revenue growth within server products and cloud services, partially offset by a decline in our Transactional
        on-premises server business.
        Enterprise Services revenue grew 12%, 14% in constant currency, as customer demand for Windows Server 2003 and
        the support agreement and Premier Services continued this quarter. Gross margin dollars grew 1% and 5% in
        constant currency. And gross margin percentages declined as cloud mix accelerated. This quarter, operating
        income declined 17%, driven by investment in sales resources and engineering.
        Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing; revenue was $8.9 billion, down 4% and 2% in constant
        currency. First, our OEM results; our total OEM business grew 11% this quarter, outperforming the overall PC
        market, which was better than we expected in most markets, including the U.S., the UK, and Germany, partially
        offset by incremental weakness in India and Russia. OEM non-Pro revenue increased 27%, and similar to last
        quarter, was driven by a higher mix of premium devices. OEM Pro revenue grew 2%, reflecting a stabilizing
        commercial PC market and a higher mix of business PCs sold with Windows Pro. Inventory across both OEM Pro and
        non-Pro remained at normal levels.
        Windows volume licensing grew 3% and 9% in constant currency, with ongoing annuity growth. IP licensing
        declined, impacted by both a decrease in total unit volume and lower revenue per unit.
        We continued to execute well in our search business this quarter. And as we committed, Bing was profitable for
        the full fiscal year, driven by increasing revenue per search and search volume. As expected, devices revenue
        significantly decreased this quarter. Revenue declined 35%, also 35% in constant currency due to phone, where
        revenue declined 70% in constant currency.
        Surface revenue increased 9% in constant currency, as Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book growth was partially offset
        by unit declines in our prior-generation Surface 3. And in gaming, revenue declined 9% or 8% in constant
        currency, driven by lower Xbox 360 unit volume and reduced Xbox One pricing. Our overall gaming ecosystem showed
        healthy growth with 49 million monthly active Xbox Live users, or a 33% increase, and 4% Xbox Live revenue
        growth.
        Segment gross margin dollars declined 3% or roughly flat in constant currency, as decreases due to Xbox consoles
        and the phone inventory adjustment were partially offset by our OEM and search results.
        Operating expenses decreased this quarter by 13%, based primarily on reduced phone spend and the transition of
        display advertising sales to AOL, resulting in segment operating income growth of 59%.
        Now back to our overall company results. We invested $3.1 billion in capital expenditures, consistent with our
        plan for accelerated investment, as we added both commercial and consumer global cloud capacity to meet
        near-term and longer-term customer demand. During the quarter, we continued to rebalance our investment
        portfolio, which resulted in other income and expense of $267 million from net recognized gains on investments,
        partially offset by interest expense.
        Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 15% this quarter, lower than we expected. Our income tax expense reflected a
        favorable mix between U.S. and foreign countries as well as benefits associated with distributions from foreign
        affiliates. This quarter, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.
        Before turning to next quarter's outlook, I want to share our view on the shape of next fiscal year. My
        commentary both on the year and next quarter does not include LinkedIn. However, we still expect the transaction
        to close in the second quarter.
        For the full year, we expect the FX impact to lessen throughout the year, assuming current rates remain stable.
        In H1, we expect a total impact of one point, reducing to zero in H2. The fundamentals of our Commercial
        business remain strong, and we anticipate that cloud services and healthy renewals will continue to drive high
        annuity mix.
        As I've noted before, our commercial Transactional business is influenced by different dynamics. Most important,
        it's impacted by a structural transition to the cloud across all workloads. But it's also more sensitive to
        overall macroeconomic conditions and changes in corporate budgets. We expect volatility, as we saw in both Q3
        and Q4 this year, to continue in the next fiscal year.
        Before discussing our total company gross margin expectations, let me first address Commercial Cloud gross
        margin. We expect the Commercial Cloud gross margin percentage and dollars to materially improve next fiscal
        year. We have invested heavily to build share, expand geographically, and ensure world-class support and
        reliability for our commercial customers. Going forward, we expect those investments to provide benefits of
        scale. We also anticipate our cloud capital expenditure growth curve will slow. Given seasonality and revenue
        mix, Commercial Cloud gross margin will see variability quarter to quarter but an overall trend of material
        improvement. At the company level, as each cloud service continues to grow and improve its gross margin
        percentage, our company gross margin should only decline roughly a point in FY 2017.
        We now expect our full-year operating expense will be $31.1 billion to $31.4 billion, as we continue to
        prioritize spend on strategic growth opportunities.
        Lastly, our effective tax rate. Our tax rate is impacted by three factors: the proportion of services revenue
        versus licensing revenue; the geographic mix of revenue; and the timing of equity vests. As our cloud continues
        to gain momentum, we expect our tax rate to increase. With quarterly variability based on these factors, we
        anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to be 20% for the full year plus or minus two points.
        Now for the outlook for the next quarter. Based on current currency rates and forecasted geographic mix of
        revenue, we expect two points of negative impact on total revenue in Q1. By segment, the negative impact is two
        points in Productivity and Business Process, two points in Intelligent Cloud, and one point in More Personal
        Computing.
        We expect Commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of $21.8 billion to $22 billion, in line with
        historic seasonality. In Productivity and Business Process, we expect revenue to be $6.4 billion to $6.6
        billion. We will continue to grow our install base and drive premium mix through offers like Office 365 E5. We
        anticipate continued transactional declines as customer migration to the cloud accelerates.
        In our Consumer business, we will outpace the consumer PC market, but the benefit from Japan's improved results
        over a weak prior period and the benefit from last year's Office 2016 launch are not expected to repeat.
        For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $6.1 billion and $6.3 billion, driven by continued annuity
        strength across Azure and our hybrid cloud offerings, offset by ongoing declines in our transactional
        on-premises server business, and moderating growth from support agreements in Enterprise Services.
        In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $8.7 billion and $9 billion. We anticipate that our OEM
        revenue will be more in line with overall PC market trends. Devices revenue will decline again from our actions
        in phone. Gaming revenue will be driven by the same factors as in Q4. And in search, we expect Bing's growth
        trajectory to continue. We expect COGS to be $7.5 billion to $7.6 billion, with variability due to device sales.
        We expect operating expenses between $7.35 billion and $7.45 billion. We expect other income and expenses to be
        approximately zero, as realized gains on investments should offset debt expense.
        And with that, Chris, let's go to Q&amp;A.
        Chris Suh - General Manager-Investor Relations
        Thanks, Amy. We'll move now to the Q&amp;A section. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
        Question-and-Answer Session
        Operator
        Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
        Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC
        <segment features="dialogue-move; preface" id="1" state="active">Excellent, thank you, guys, for taking the
            question and a very nice quarter.I wanted to dig into Azure, maybe one question for Satya and one question
            for Amy.Satya, you mentioned the Boeing agreement.What was interesting about that is not just a large
            company moving significant workloads onto Azure.But from my reading, it sounds like there's a distribution
            side of this agreement that you guys are going to help them distribute some of those applications on a
            going-forward basis.
        </segment>
        <segment features="dialogue-move; question; prefaced-yes" id="2" state="active">I was wondering if you could
            touch a little bit on that.Is that a one-time thing, or is that something that you look to do more often
            with some of these large companies, moving workloads onto Azure?
        </segment>
        <segment features="dialogue-move; preface" id="3" state="active">And then for Amy, thank you for the additional
            detail on the cloud gross margin profile on a going-forward basis.When we dig into just Azure, you said in
            the past that you expect to match the gross margin profile of what we're seeing in Amazon Web Services.
        </segment>
        <segment features="dialogue-move; question; prefaced-yes" id="4" state="active">Does that commentary still
            hold?And maybe you can give us a mark-to-market on how you're doing in terms of matching up Azure's gross
            margin profile to what you're seeing from your top competitor there.
        </segment>
        Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
        <segment features="dialogue-move; preface" id="5" state="active">Thank you.So, Satya or Amy, last quarter the
            stock was hit in part on a deceleration in your on-premise server product business, and I think your
            commentary around the Transactional part of that suggested it softened a little bit.I think your tone on
            this call is a lot better around the Transactional performance, and it looks like that business accelerated
            a little bit.Perhaps you could explain what changed in the course of the three months to make the
            transactional piece, at least if I'm hearing you correctly, feel a little bit better.Thank you.
        </segment>
        Satya Nadella - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director
        <segment features="dialogue-move; reply; answer" id="6" state="active">Let me start, and then, Amy, you can add
            to it.Overall, Karl, the focus for us is in what I describe as this hyperscale-plus-hybrid approach when you
            think about the current approach, which is pretty unique to us.And the way we track progress is to see how
            is our annuity growth of our server business, and how is our cloud growth.And if you look at this last
            quarter, our annuity grew double digits and our cloud grew triple digits.And that's a pretty healthy growth
            rate, and that's something that by design both in terms of the technical architecture as well as the
            traction we have in the marketplace and our sales efforts and so on are playing out well, and we are very
            bullish about that going forward.The Transactional business is much more volatile because of the macro
            environment, IT budgets, and also the secular shift to the cloud.The question again that gets asked is about
            the cannibalization.But if you look at Boeing or you look at any of the other examples that I talk about
            when it comes to the cloud, our servers never did what these customers are now doing in our cloud.So at a
            fundamental long-term secular basis, we have new growth, new workloads, and that's what we are focused on,
            and that's a much bigger addressable market than anything our Transactional Server business had in the past.

        Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC
        <segment features="dialogue-move; preface" id="7" state="active">Thanks.Amy, in Q3 the Transactional business
            was weak, and you said that the business bounced back in Q4.
        </segment>
        <segment features="dialogue-move; question; prefaced-yes" id="8" state="active">Was that just a mere fact of you
            cleaning up some of the slipped business, or did you see additional strength on top of some of those closed
            transactions on the Transactional business in Q4?
        </segment>
        Amy E. Hood - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President
        <segment features="dialogue-move; reply; answer" id="9" state="active">Thanks, Brent.Let me split your question
            into two components.The first thing really that I think Satya and I both focus on every quarter, every
            month, is how much of our business are we continuing to shift to annuity and specifically to the cloud.We
            structure all of our motions at this company, from how we engineer to how we do our go-to-markets to how we
            think about sales engagement to how we do our investments, fundamentally toward that long-term structural
            transition in the market.And so to your question on Transactional performance, there were some deals that
            didn't get done in Q3 that got done in Q4, and there were some deals done in Q4 on the Office side with
            large companies that I'm thrilled by.But at the same time, we still will focus on those deals moving to the
            cloud over time.And so this volatility that we are going to see because of macro and because of budget
            constraints, especially on Transactional, we will focus on because we expect excellent execution and have
            accountability to do that in the field.But our first priority, every time, is to make sure we are focused on
            annuity growth and digital transformation at our company, which is best done through that motion.

        <segment features="dialogue-move; question; prefaced-no" id="10" state="active">Just to be clear, Amy, in terms

        Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.
        <segment features="dialogue-move; preface" id="12" state="active">Great.Satya, I had a question for you on
            Azure.
        </segment>
        <segment features="dialogue-move; question; prefaced-yes" id="13" state="active">I was just wondering if you
            could talk about the percentage of Azure revenue coming from ISVs.And then how do you see this helping you
            compete with AWS?And can you talk about why these partners may be choosing you over the competition?
        </segment>
        <segment features="dialogue-move; preface" id="14" state="active">Thank you.</segment>
        Satya Nadella - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director
        <segment features="dialogue-move; reply; answer" id="15" state="active">Sure, let me take that second part in
            terms of what is our differentiation.And I think in my remarks, I pointed out the couple of dimensions.But
            overall, I believe this hyperscale plus hybrid architecturally helps us a lot with enterprise customers
            because we meet them where their realities are today and also the digital transformation needs going
            forward, so that's one massive advantage we have.The second area for us is also the nexus between what's
            happening in Office 365, Dynamics 365, AppSource.And in fact, this last quarter, some of the most strategic
            announcements were all around our application platform.At our partner conference, there was a significant
            amount of excitement with the tools that we announced like PowerApps and Power BI, Azure functions and
            Flow.These are tools that our developers and system integrators and solution partners will use in order to
            be able to customize applications around Azure.And so to me that's another huge advantage and a competitive
            differentiation for us.And then lastly, we have the best support for what I would say is the most open
            platform for all developers.Not only is .NET first class but Linux is first class, Java is first class.Azure
            Container service cuts across both containers running on Windows, running across Linux.So again, it speaks
            to the enterprise reality.So those would be the places where we are fairly differentiated, and that's what
            you see us gaining both for enterprise customers and ISVs.The question you asked is an interesting one,
            which is if I had to slice it by classic ISVs, it would be one-third or so of our revenue.But the thing that
            the first question that Keith asked is probably more indicative of what's happening, which is every customer
            is also an ISV.So every customer who starts off consuming Azure is also turning what is their IP in most
            cases into an ISV solution, which ultimately will even participate in AppSource.So at least the vision that
            we have is that every customer is a digital company that will have a digital IP component to it, and that we
            want to be able to partner with them in pretty unique ways.I would also add, Heather, the importance of the
            motion in our field organization and go-to-market with ISVs is incredibly high in terms of selling with and
            along with those ISVs, both making them successful and thereby helping us build very important scale through
            the platform.And we've seen a lot of improvement in the past four quarters on that front.

        <segment features="dialogue-move; question; prefaced-yes" id="17" state="active">Amy, how much of the weakness
            in Transactional has been caused by clients that otherwise would have bought a license now under annuity?In
            other words, are you driving the Transactional weakness to some extent by driving the growth in on-prem?

        <segment features="dialogue-move; preface" id="18" state="active">And then I have a quick follow-up for Satya.

        Amy E. Hood - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President
        <segment features="dialogue-move; reply; answer" id="19" state="active">It's probably not exactly how I would
            say it, Mark.I do believe that every conversation that we're having with customers is cloud-led.That
            cloud-led conversation and making a plan for customers to best change and transform their own business
            certainly is a far more in-depth one than on occasion is required by long-time Transactional purchasers,
            especially in Office, as an example, because what we're talking about now is really pivoting your business
            for the long term.And so I'm sure there are examples where that has elongated the sales cycle, for good
            reason.But I would generally point back and say most of these are driven at the structural level, which is
            structurally over time, on-premises Transactional business will move to the cloud or to a hybrid structure
            through an annuity revenue stream.Now over any short-term period, the majority of what we have seen is
            really either a budget constraint, a macroeconomic change, or people, to the question you've laid out, maybe
            in the midst of making their cloud transition plan, and maybe that has elongated the sales cycle to an
            extent.But again, I don't view that as negative performance.I view that as strategic relevance long term
            inside of digital accounts.

        <segment features="dialogue-move; question; prefaced-yes" id="21" state="active">Amy, I'm wondering, you saw
            very strong unearned revenue in the quarter, but I note that you saw contracted backlog that grew
            sequentially below what a typical June quarter does and commercial bookings that were up about 4% off of a
            fairly easy comp.And I'm wondering if you could just help us understand the dynamics in new and renewal
            signings that drove that combination of really strong unearned but somewhat weaker trends in the bookings.
        </segment>
        Amy E. Hood - Chief Financial Officer &amp; Executive Vice President
        <segment features="dialogue-move; reply; answer" id="22" state="active">Sure.Strong unearned in particular was
            actually better than expected Azure billings in the quarter that drove unearned above the high end of our
            guide, and I think we were quite pleased by that performance.In terms of CNB, that's the reference I made in
            my comments to the lower expiry base.Quarter to quarter and year to year, we just have different amounts of
            contracts expiring.And so this was one of our lower contract bases and was lower than a year ago.So the fact
            that we were able to grow in that low expiry base is actually very good structural performance.

            center regions today.I think you have 34 planned, so that would imply we're about three-quarters of the way
            through that spending cycle.

        <segment features="dialogue-move; question; prefaced-yes" id="24" state="active">But should we view 34 as a

        <segment features="dialogue-move; preface" id="25" state="active">And then I had one follow-up.</segment>
        Satya Nadella - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director
        <segment features="dialogue-move; reply; answer" id="26" state="active">Let me start, and then, Amy, you can add
            to this.In some sense, Ross, you're trying to ask us to project forward and say what is the legitimate
            digital security and digital sovereignty needs of all the different types of businesses that we want to
            serve using the cloud all over the world.The position that we have taken is that we want to serve customers
            where they are and not assume very simplistically that the digital sovereignty needs of customers can be met
            out of a fewer data center approach.Because right now, given the secular trend to move to the cloud across
            all of the regulated industries across the globe, we think it's wiser for us and our investors long term to
            be able to meet them where they are.And that's what you see us.We are the only cloud that operates in China
            under Chinese law, the only cloud that operates in Germany under German law.And these are very critical
            competitive advantages to us.And so we will track that, and we will be very demand driven.So in this case
            we're not taking these positions of which regions to open and where to open them well in advance of our
            demand.If anything, I think our cycle times have significantly come down.So it will be demand-driven, but I
            don't want to essentially put a cap because if the opportunity arises, and for us it's a high ROI decision
            to open a new region, we will do so.And I would add, in addition to the number of regions which Satya is
            talking about, it's also the capacity inside a region.Much of our spend is, as you note, on some of the
            infrastructure to put in place when you pick a location.The rest of it is continuing to build out in that
            location the number of servers and networking equipment required.So there are really two components, and I
            think Satya has talked about why you would enter a region and its ROI, and there's also the correlation to
            how many servers and that spend and pace over time based on demand.

            it.Overall, I would say even in this last year, even just a broader spread of E3 has driven a lot of the
            growth.And then of course, we are very excited about E5, but they're very, very early days of E5.And E5
            value proposition across all three of the areas, whether it's cloud voice or analytics or security are all
            three massive areas for us.And I would say if anything, the initial data from our customers around security
            is gaining a lot of traction.But at the same time, one of the things that customers are looking for is
            making an enterprise-wide architectural decision across all of the workloads.So E3, E5, and higher
            penetration of this is what's going to drive ASP growth.And you will look you can see you'll see us add more
            value to these packages as time goes on as well because our R&amp;D is focused on that, which is how do we
